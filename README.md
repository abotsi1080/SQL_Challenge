# SQL_Challenge
This repository will contain all of the SQL assignment

For this challenge assignment, a complete repository was created first to host all documents related to the assignment.
All the csv files were uploaded to the local git folder
For this assignment, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created using the quick database diagrams @ (http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com). A full sketch of the different tables and keys helped create the table schema for the ERD. The table schema is in the respoitory and name "ERD.png"
An SQL schemata was generated and named "Schemata.sql"
The database design was completed and all tables uploaded sequentially based on the order of relationship in the schemata.
Lastly, the main SQL queries were executed and saved as "Queries.sql"
